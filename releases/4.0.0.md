### Notes
#### Periodic Migration guide from 3.0.0
```
# move content/extensions/extensions.json, content/extensions/log, content/extensions/restart.json to content/config
# delete content/extensions directory
# install latest version of periodic
$ npm install forever -g # install forever
$ cd /path/to/web/app
$ npm install periodicjs@3.1.2 --prefix ./ # or $ npm install periodicjs@latest 
```
#### Periodic Runtime Options
```
$ npm start --e [name-of-environment (development by default)] # runs nodemon
$ npm run forever --e [name-of-environment (development by default)] # runs forever + nodemon
$ npm run deploy --e [name-of-environment (development by default)] # deploys with pm2
$ npm run sync # syncs dependencies
```
Running npm start saves the environment in `content/config/process/runtime.json`, if no environment is specified, it will reload in this environment, this is helpful server restarts
